### This script uses the vcf-file from Feiner et al., 2024, Science Advances, as input file.
### It calculates patterns of D-statistics surrounding the morph-determining loci and a locus (RAB18) known to introgress from the Central Italy lineage into the Southern Alps lineage

# Using Dsuite and bcftools/1.20

# First extract the respective chromosomes
# Chr. 12 for RAB18
bcftools filter GATK_all_SNP_final.vcf.gz -r CM014754.1 > RAB18_Chr12.vcf 
# Chr. 15 for BCO2
bcftools filter GATK_all_SNP_final.vcf.gz -r CM014757.1 > BCO2_Chr15.vcf 
# Chr. 9 for SPR
bcftools filter GATK_all_SNP_final.vcf.gz -r CM014751.1 > SPR_Chr9.vcf 

# Use as input for Dinvestigate (from the Dsuite); note that the SETs differ because only homozygous white alleles are retained for the color loci.
# RAB18
./Dsuite/Build/Dsuite Dinvestigate -w 100,50 RAB18_Chr12.vcf SETS_RAB18.txt trios.txt
# BCO2
./Dsuite/Build/Dsuite Dinvestigate -w 100,50 BCO2_Chr15.vcf SETS_BCO2.txt trios.txt
# SPR
./Dsuite/Build/Dsuite Dinvestigate -w 100,50 SPR_Chr9.vcf SETS_SPR.txt trios.txt

# trios.txt contained the following line to specify which configuration to test:
# P1  P2  P3

# the resulting output is plotted with the R_script '05_Dstatistics_Geneflow.R' and shown in Fig. S1.
